Letter:
I'm a student of mobile developement currently at the last year. My favourite game generes are FPS and Horror. I love playing Call of Duty (mainly zombie mode, BO3 is my favourite), Doom series and Outlast. I would like Something engaging that could absorb me in action and chaos and also terrific jumpscares. Even if I play many FPS the game could be a 2D game (psst... in that case pixel art would be really appreciated). I hope to get a lot of terror from you!

Love, franz4417
